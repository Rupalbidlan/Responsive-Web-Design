it is vary big code pls  show me that part only that have issues 
ChatGPT
Sure, the part of the code with the issues is related to the accordion functionality in the onclick attributes. Here is the corrected portion:

html
Copy code
<div class="w3-col m7">
<button onclick="accFunction('what')" class="w3-black w3-button w3-block w3-left-align">What We Do</button>
<div id="what" class="w3-container w3-show">

  <p>We apply a systematic approach to complex and simple projects. We follow Agile methodology, Scrum and Kanban, which allow our dedicated team to
    deliver exceptional apps on time. Agile software development involves different ways of dealing with software development in which requirements and solutions 
    evolve through the collaborative efforts of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s) or end user(s). It includes adaptive planning, cutting-edge

  </p>

<button onclick="accFunction('where')" class="w3-black w3-button w3-block w3-left-align">Where We Are</button>
<div id="where" class="w3-container w3-hide">

    then the timeline will range from 6 to 7 months.
  </p>
</div>
</div>
Additionally, ensure your JavaScript function accFunction is defined correctly. Here is the corrected JavaScript function:

html
Copy code
<script>
function accFunction(id) {
  var x = document.getElementById(id);
  if (x.className.indexOf("w3-show") == -1) {
    x.className += " w3-show";
  } else {
    x.className = x.className.replace(" w3-show", "");
  }
}
</script>
</body>
